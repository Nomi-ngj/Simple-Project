# Simple-Project
VIPER is a design pattern used for developing iOS applications with modular, scalable, and testable architecture. In this article, I will explain how VIPER works and its benefits for creating clean and organized project structures.

Additionally, I will demonstrate how to retrieve user data from the API endpoint https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users and display it in the app by parsing the JSON data and mapping it to our app's model objects. For networking, we will use a GET API from https://github.com/Nomi-ngj/SpiderWebService, created recently.

Please note that this project does not include UI design, but I will try to provide a smooth user interface and user experience for the app.

During the development process, I may face various issues and problems. Therefore, any feedback or suggestions are welcome, and you can contact me for comments or suggestions.
